# Template Website for a Software Engineer

This is a project that I did to practice my HTML and CSS skills. The website is coded from scratch with HTML and CSS, and is responsive across all screen sizes. If you would like to use parts of this website for your own website, you are most welcome to do so.

I have a live demo of the website hosted on GitHub pages, which you can check out below:

### Credits

- Icons used in the skills section and the social media icons provided by font awesome
- Svg icons used in the technical skills section provided by icons8
- Placeholder text in projects and services generated by Raycast's Lorem Ipsum generator extension
- All images used taken from unsplash, pixabay, or pexels

### JavaScript File

At the time of working on this project, I haven't got to learning JavaScript yet. I've included a JavaScript file though to include some features that cannot be done with just HTML and CSS. The script file used is provided by Jonas Schmedtmann, the instructor of the course I took to learn HTML and CSS.

Functionality provided by the Script file:

- Automatically update copyright year
- Smooth scrolling animation from navigation bar elements
- Add functionality to mobile navigation
- Fix an issue with flexbox gap property in some older versions of Safari

Thank you for checking this project out. If you notice anything wrong, I'd appreciate it if you could let me know through email (hello@vivyde.com)
